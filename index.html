        <h2>Let's start with some personal information:</h2>
      <div class="little_text">
        <p>My name is Marcos Andr√© Vieira Flores. I'm currently 39 years old (with a face of 50, a body of seventy and the maturity of a 5 years old). I was born in Brasilia, capital of Brazil, and lived here ever since.</p>
        <p>I'm the third of four siblings (three men and a woman). My parents were born on the southernmost Brazilian state, Rio Grande do Sul. My father is a vegetarian gaucho, believe it or not.</p>
        <p> I honestly love mathemathics, logic and all computer related. I also love history, to read science fiction and fantasy, to listen to old rock music and watch crime stories on the youtube.</p>

        <h2>Now to the more serious information:</h2>
        <p> I went to University of Brasilia (UnB) and graduated on International Relations (no, I don't know what we do either). Then I joined the Brazilian Public Administration, first on the Ministry of Education and later on the Planning Ministry (currently the Ministry of Economy).</p>
        <p>Today I work on the Digital Government Secretary, on the Department of User Experience. My main activities are related with the area of public services of the Brazilian Goverment Portal (gov.br), on content evaluation and control and on data analysis.</p>
        <p>The turn away of the area I studied was partly intentional. I found out I prefer to work with, and I believe I can work better on the data and coding area. Now I am working on improving my knowledge and skills to do it.</p>
